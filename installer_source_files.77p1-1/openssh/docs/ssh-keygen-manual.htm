<a name="DESCRIPTION" href="#end"><B>DESCRIPTION</B></a>
     <B>ssh-keygen</B> generates, manages and converts authentication keys for
     <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&sektion=1&arch=&apropos=0&manpath=OpenBSD+Current">ssh(1)</A>. <B>ssh-keygen</B> can create RSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 1
     and RSA or DSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 2. The type of key to
     be generated is specified with the <B>-t</B> option.

     Normally each user wishing to use SSH with RSA or DSA authentication runs
     this once to create the authentication key in <I>$HOME/.ssh/identity</I>,
     <I>$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa</I> or <I>$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa</I>. Additionally, the system adminis-
     trator may use this to generate host keys, as seen in <I>/etc/rc</I>.

     Normally this program generates the key and asks for a file in which to
     store the private key.  The public key is stored in a file with the same
     name but ``.pub'' appended.  The program also asks for a passphrase.  The
     passphrase may be empty to indicate no passphrase (host keys must have an
     empty passphrase), or it may be a string of arbitrary length.  A
     passphrase is similar to a password, except it can be a phrase with a se-
     ries of words, punctuation, numbers, whitespace, or any string of charac-
     ters you want.  Good passphrases are 10-30 characters long, are not sim-
     ple sentences or otherwise easily guessable (English prose has only 1-2
     bits of entropy per character, and provides very bad passphrases), and
     contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanu-
     meric characters.  The passphrase can be changed later by using the <B>-p</B>
     option.

     There is no way to recover a lost passphrase.  If the passphrase is lost
     or forgotten, a new key must be generated and copied to the corresponding
     public key to other machines.

     For RSA1 keys, there is also a comment field in the key file that is only
     for convenience to the user to help identify the key.  The comment can
     tell what the key is for, or whatever is useful.  The comment is initial-
     ized to ``user@host'' when the key is created, but can be changed using
     the <B>-c</B> option.

     After a key is generated, instructions below detail where the keys should
     be placed to be activated.

     The options are as follows:

     <B>-b</B> <I>bits</I>
             Specifies the number of bits in the key to create.  Minimum is
             512 bits.  Generally 1024 bits is considered sufficient, and key
             sizes above that no longer improve security but make things slow-
             er.  The default is 1024 bits.

     <B>-c</B>      Requests changing the comment in the private and public key
             files.  This operation is only supported for RSA1 keys.  The pro-
             gram will prompt for the file containing the private keys, for
             the passphrase if the key has one, and for the new comment.

     <B>-e</B>      This option will read a private or public OpenSSH key file and
             print the key in a `SECSH Public Key File Format' to stdout.
             This option allows exporting keys for use by several commercial
             SSH implementations.

     <B>-f</B> <I>filename</I>
             Specifies the filename of the key file.

     <B>-i</B>      This option will read an unencrypted private (or public) key file
             in SSH2-compatible format and print an OpenSSH compatible private
             (or public) key to stdout.  <B>ssh-keygen</B> also reads the `SECSH
             Public Key File Format'. This option allows importing keys from
             several commercial SSH implementations.

     <B>-l</B>      Show fingerprint of specified public key file.  Private RSA1 keys
             are also supported.  For RSA and DSA keys <B>ssh-keygen</B> tries to
             find the matching public key file and prints its fingerprint.

     <B>-p</B>      Requests changing the passphrase of a private key file instead of
             creating a new private key.  The program will prompt for the file
             containing the private key, for the old passphrase, and twice for
             the new passphrase.

     <B>-q</B>      Silence <B>ssh-keygen</B>. Used by <I>/etc/rc</I> when creating a new key.

     <B>-y</B>      This option will read a private OpenSSH format file and print an
             OpenSSH public key to stdout.

     <B>-t</B> <I>type</I>
             Specifies the type of the key to create.  The possible values are
             ``rsa1'' for protocol version 1 and ``rsa'' or ``dsa'' for proto-
             col version 2.

     <B>-B</B>      Show the bubblebabble digest of specified private or public key
             file.

     <B>-C</B> <I>comment</I>
             Provides the new comment.

     <B>-D</B> <I>reader</I>
             Download the RSA public key stored in the smartcard in <I>reader</I>.

     <B>-N</B> <I>new_passphrase</I>
             Provides the new passphrase.

     <B>-P</B> <I>passphrase</I>
             Provides the (old) passphrase.

     <B>-U</B> <I>reader</I>
             Upload an existing RSA private key into the smartcard in <I>reader</I>.
